            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

This was the most I intended to say to you, but there is an unquiet Spirit abroad, which every day throws in new accidents to disturb, and confound the publique Peace. How I was driven from London, when I chose this place for my safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is so notorious that all men know it, who know any thing; with what strange violence, and indignities I have been pursued, since I came hither, needs no other e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, then Sir <hi>Iohn Hothams</hi> behaviour at Hull, who is now arrived at that insolence, that hee will not suffer his Treason to be longer confined within those Walls but makes Sallyes out of the Towne, upon his fellow Subjects

I am sure my di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections have been very strict in that point, and if they had not bin observed, I think I should have heard of it by nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer complaints, then from London; I pray God the same care may be taken there: I am sure it hath not been.

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:197433:3"/>no honest man can imagine. But it seemes other men are not of my minde, but resolve to make a Warre at your owne doores, whatsoever you do, or I suffer. To what purpose else is their new Generall armed with an au hority to kill and destroy all my good Subjects; their levies of Horse and Foote, some whereof are upon their March to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you, with Canon mounted, and the sending so many new Souldiers into <hi>Hull,</hi> when there is no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach made towards it, but to sally out, and to commit Rapine, and by degrees to poure out an Army upon you: In this I must aske your advice, what you will doe for your selves, what you would have me doe for you.

            <p>Gentlemen, I desire you to consider what course is to be taken for your owne security from the excursions from <hi>Hull,</hi> and the violence which threatens you from thence: I will assist you any way you propose. Next, I desire you, out of the publike Provision, or your private Store, to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish me with such a number of Armes (Musquets and Coslets) as you may conveniently spare, which I doe promise to see fully repaid to you: These Armes I desire may be speedily delivered to the custody of my Lord Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor of Yorke, for my use, principally from those parts, which by reason of their distance from <hi>Hull</hi> are least sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the feare of violence from thence. And whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver shall so furnish me, shall be excused from their atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance and service at Musters, till their. Armes shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored; which may well be sooner than I can promise, or you expect. I desire nothing of you but what is necessary to be done for the preservation of Gods true Religion, the Lawes of the Land, the Liberty of the Subject, and the very being of the Kingdome of England: for 'tis too evident all these are at stake.</p>
            <p>For the Compleating my Sonnes Regiment for the guard of my Person, under the command of my Lord of Cumberland, I referre it wholly to your selves, who have expressed such for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnesse in it.</p>
